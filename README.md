# Todolist-Website-with-Newsletter-Signup-link
This is a to-do list page where you can add your daily schedule and cross it off when you're done. You can categorize your daily schedule, and any category is customizable by you. You just need to type "/your custom name" after the URL to enter your custom category to add and complete the schedule.
Inside this URL is a Newsletter sign-up link that you can sign up for to receive emails about site feature additions and page updates! It is done by using mailchimp. I also upload my Newsletter signup website's code here.
